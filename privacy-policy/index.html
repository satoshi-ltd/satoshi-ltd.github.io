        <p>
          On-Device Storage: All data, including financial records or user
          configurations, is securely stored on your device. It never leaves
          your device unless you choose to export it.

          Export Options: Our applications provide users with the option to
          export data to a physical file. This file remains entirely under the

          While Satoshi Ltd does not store user data on servers or in the cloud,
          we employ robust encryption and security mechanisms to protect data
          stored on the device. Users are encouraged to secure their devices
          with passwords, PINs, or biometric methods to prevent unauthorized
          access.
